<h1 style="text-align:center">About The Hub City Zoo in Lubbock, Texas</h1>

<h2><p>What a beautiful time to bring a zoo like this one to the Hub City aka Lubbock, Texas. The zoo is a huge one with a bunch of exotic looking animals. If it gets too humid during the summer time, this establishment will provide sprays that will be hanging along like wires through the park. During the cold months, we will be closed until Spring or whenever the weather is decent for the workers and the people of Lubbock who enjoy animals. This zoo will have an omnimax theater that will show different types of movies and even animal related motion pictures from the past and the present and even ones that are currently showing at the movie theater. We will be adding on to the park, a Sea World like park to add more exciting things to do while the vistors of the park are here. The prices will be only for the zoo, we will provide you with a stamp that will allow you to enjoy both parks when the new park opens up in late 2019.</h2></p>
<h2><p>We will be updating more when we get more information about the zoo and the new park that will be opening up.</h2></p>
